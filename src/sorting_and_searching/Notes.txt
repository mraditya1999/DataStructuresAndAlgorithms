** Stable sort **
- A sorting algorithm is stable if it maintains the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e., values).
- If two items have the same value and appear in a certain order in the input, they will remain in that order in the output.
- eg: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, time sort

** Unstable Sort **
- A sorting algorithm is unstable if it does not maintain the relative order of records with equal keys.
- This means that items with the same value may not appear in the same order in the output as they do in the input.
- eg: quick sort, heap sort, selection sort

1) bubble sort => worst case - O(n2) | best case - O(n) | in-place algorithm
2) selection sort => worst case - O(n2) | best case - O(n2) | in-place algorithm
3) insertion sort => worst case - O(n2) | best case - O(n) | in-place algorithm
