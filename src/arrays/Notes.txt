- All values of array will be 0 by default.
- Once Array is created it cannot be modified.
- We can create another array of bigger size and copy previous array.
- Arrays always be created in heap.
- Every array has length property which store array length.
- int a [] = new int [5]; OR int[] a = new int [5]; OR int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5}.
- forEach Loop cannot modify the array values.
- int [] a - reference variable which stores address of array (present in heap).
- new int [5]- memory allocated in heap.

** Shallow Copy **
- A shallow copy of an object copies the object itself and references to other objects that the original object references.
- This means that the shallow copy and the original object share references to the same objects.
- Leading to potential side effects, if one of them modifies a shared object.
- Both the original and the shallow copy will reference the same nested objects.

** Deep Copy **
- A deep copy of an object copies the object itself and also creates copies of all objects referenced by the original object.
- This means that the deep copy and the original object do not share references to the same objects.
- Modifications in one will not affect the other.
- Both the original and the deep copy will reference their own separate instances of nested objects.
